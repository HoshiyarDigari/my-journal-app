1. 'DOMContentLoaded' is the event to use with addEventListener to trigger JS function after page is loaded
example:
addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', setDate)
function setDate(){}

2. We should only specify function name setDate and not setDate(), the latter will call the function right away. We just need to pass the function's reference.
